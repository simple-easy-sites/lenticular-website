  { id: 'f3', question: "How quickly will I see more leads or jobs?", answer: "You'll see professional, high-quality content almost immediately. For more leads and calls, it typically takes 30-60 days as we build your online presence. Serious growth and system optimization usually hit their stride around 90 days." },
  { id: 'f4', question: "Do you only work with home service businesses?", answer: "We specialize in home services because we understand your challenges. However, our systems can help any service-based business that wants to get more professional online and grow efficiently." },

Itâ€™s your all-in-one solution to dominate online." },
